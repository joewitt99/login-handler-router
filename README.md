# login-handler-router

This example provides a basic router solution for overriding the Okta landing page.  It uses OIDC and Okta groups to determine a landing page when a user goes directly to Okta's landing page.

Steps to configure:
1. Request Federation Broker mode feature flag
2. Create OIDC application in Okta
3. Modify index.js to provide your application and tenant configurations 
4. Deploy to webserver.
5. Configure "Default App for Sign-In Widget" in Okta admin customization to point to the deployed application.

## Building and deployment

To begin, you'll need to install `node.js` version >10:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

A `dist` folder will be create containing the index.html and minified js file which performs the OIDC and router logic.

This can be deployed to any webserver, amazon s3 or equivalent.
